## **Project Overview**

The **Agro-Processing Operations Management System** is a conceptual web-based solution developed to demonstrate how digital systems can improve operational effectiveness within Ghana’s agro-processing sector.

The system visually represents key operational processes involved in maize and cassava processing, including raw material buffering, energy reliability, preventive maintenance, and by-product utilization.
It is intended for **academic evaluation, system design demonstration, and portfolio showcase**.

---

## **Key Objectives**

* Digitally model agro-processing operations in a clear and intuitive interface
* Demonstrate operational problem-solving using dashboards and KPIs
* Showcase modern UI/UX practices for industrial management systems
* Provide a static, deployable frontend suitable for GitHub Pages

---

## **System Features**

### **1. Landing Page**

* Overview of the agro-processing system
* Clear value proposition and operational focus
* Professional call-to-action layout

### **2. Management Dashboard**

* KPI cards (production output, stock levels, energy savings)
* Interactive charts using mock data
* Real-time-style alerts and notifications

### **3. Inventory & Buffer Stock Module**

* Visual tracking of maize and cassava stock levels
* Low-stock and threshold alerts
* Storage status indicators

### **4. Energy & Sustainability Module**

* Solar and biomass energy usage visualization
* Power outage simulation
* Energy cost savings indicators

### **5. Maintenance Management (CMMS)**

* Equipment status cards
* Preventive maintenance schedules
* Downtime and maintenance history logs

### **6. By-Product Utilization Module**

* Tracking of cassava peels and maize husks
* Waste-to-value performance indicators
* Sustainability-focused metrics

## **Technology Stack**

* **HTML5** – semantic structure
* **CSS3** – modern styling (Flexbox, Grid, Glassmorphism)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** – UI logic, animations, mock data handling

> This project is strictly **frontend-only**. All data is simulated using static or mocked JSON objects.

---

## **Design Principles**

* Glassmorphism and clean industrial UI
* Dark agri-tech color palette (green / earthy tones)
* Smooth animations and micro-interactions
* Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
* Enterprise-grade visual consistency

---

## **Project Constraints**

* No backend services
* No databases
* No APIs
* Fully static and GitHub Pages–compatible

---

## **Use Case**

This system is suitable for:

* Academic project submission
* System design and analysis demonstrations
* UI/UX portfolio presentation
* Concept validation for agro-industrial digital solutions
